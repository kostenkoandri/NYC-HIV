## Executive Summary

This project offers an analysis of the efficacy of the efforts aimed at combating the HIV epidemic in New York City and assesses the alignment of these efforts with the specific needs of communities. The analysis will look into demographic data to identify groups at higher risk and see whether these communities have sufficient access to necessary support services. This analysis will explore the impact of prescription rates for Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) and Post-Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP) on the rate of new infections. Furthermore, it will investigate the influence of local programs, such as condom distribution initiatives, on the overall prevention landscape.

## Motivation

As of 2022, around 39.0 million people worldwide were living with HIV, with approximately 1.3 million new infections reported that year. Despite substantial progress in combatting the epidemic globally, the threat persists. Notably, New York City has been a significant hotspot in this ongoing challenge. In June 2014, Governor Andrew Cuomo introduced a new strategy aimed at ending the epidemic in the state. This approach involves boosting HIV screening and testing, promoting Pre-exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP), and enhancing the connection and ongoing care for individuals living with HIV. Examining the experience of New York City and evaluating the progress in its programs can provide a model (or at least a good point of reference) for other cities and communities combating the HIV epidemic.
